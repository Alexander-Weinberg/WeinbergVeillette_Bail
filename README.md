# Replication Package

This replication package produces all the tables and figures from "Do Bail Bonds Prevent Failure to Appear at Trial?" by [Alex Weinberg](https://alex-weinberg.com/) and [John Veillette](https://github.com/john-veillette). This paper was written for the undergraduate course Applied Microeconometrics taught by [Professor Ali Horta√ßsu](https://home.uchicago.edu/~hortacsu/).
