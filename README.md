# Replication Package

This replication package produces all the tables and figures from "Do Bail Bonds Prevent Failure to Appear at Trial?" by Alex Weinberg and John Veillette.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine. Make sure you have R and Make installed. The Pacman package will install the necessary dependancies while cleaning the data.

2. Download the dataset [here](https://data.ct.gov/Public-Safety/Accused-Pre-Trial-Inmates-in-Correctional-Faciliti/b674-jy6w). We accessed the website before March 22, 2019. Connecticut updates the dataset nightly.

3. From the Unix/Linux/MacOSX command line navigate to WeinbergVeillette_Bail/src and run ```make``` and you should be good to go.
